Mr. Jon Snow is a Math’s school teacher in Riverun city. One day his grandson wants a  puzzle from him. 
Jon also wants to increase the reasoning level of the child. So, he said to his grandson 
"come up with some series of numbers that must contain x  unique numbers (Integers) (xi > 0)". 
In that series, there must be two number p and q such that p < q. The numbers p, q are known to the problem solver. 
The series of numbers when sorted (element1, element2,……… elementn), the difference between adjacent elements is same i.e., 
element2 - element1 = element3 - element2,  and so on.

Among all possible such series, find the series which minimize max(element1, element2,……elementn).

Input:

The first three lines of the test case contains three integers, n where 1 < n < 50 (number of elements in the array), p, and q (the two given series elements)where 1 <= p < q <= 1000.
Basically, the input contains number of elements in the series n and two element of the arrays p,q.

Output
Print the series.
