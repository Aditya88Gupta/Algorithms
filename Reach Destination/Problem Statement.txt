Destination

Few students want to play a game in their free period.  So, they decide to play a game of co-ordinates.

The rules of game are as follows:

a) Initially, everyone will start from X-axis at point 0.
b) One can move from its current position x (x can be negative) to x+k or x-1. Here, k is the step number which starts from k=1,2,3…..n.

Determine minimum number of steps for reaching position y.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t  (1≤t≤10000) — the number of test cases.
In every test case, the first and only line contains the integer - destination point.

Output:
Print the minimum number of steps for reaching destination point.

Sample Input:
5
1
2
3
4
5
Sample Output:
1
3
2
3
4

Note
In the first test case destination=1
So, only one move require: the 1-st move from 0 to 0+1=1

In the second test case x=2
You need at least three moves:
the 1-st move from 0 to 0+1=1
the 2-nd move from 1 to 1+2=3
the 3-rd move from 3 to 3−1=2
